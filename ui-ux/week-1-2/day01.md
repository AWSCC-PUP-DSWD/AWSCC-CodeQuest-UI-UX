**_Ever catch yourself wondering about UI and UX design‚Äîwhat's the deal, and why does it matter?_**

### **User Experience[UX]**

Now, **UX** is the complete experience of a user after using the product. It cares about how easy it is to navigate the app, whether buttons make sense, and if the overall experience makes you happy. And answers the ff. questioons:

    - Who they are designing for?
    - What are the users‚Äô needs that must be fulfilled?
    - Does the (digital) product meet these needs?
