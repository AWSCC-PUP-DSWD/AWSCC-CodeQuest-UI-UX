**<h1 align="center"> DAY 6: Prototyping </h1>**
**_How do designers go about transforming static designs into interactive marvels?_**

Figma, more than just a design tool, serves as a dynamic platform where you can simulate user interactions, test functionalities, and bring your designs to life. Imagine visualizing the flow of your creations effortlessly‚Äîall within a single space.

In this exploration, we'll unravel the essentials of prototyping in Figma, breaking it down for beginners.

## Prototyping

**Prototyping** means making your designs clickable and interactive. You connect buttons and screens, add transitions and animations _(like Smart Animate for smooth moves)_, and then you can preview how it all works. Its like a sneak peek at how users will experience your app or website.

In Figma, it lets you easily share this sneak peek so others can check it out and give feedback. Prototyping is like trying out your ideas before building the real thing, helping you fix any problems early and make your design better. It's like a test drive for your digital creations!
