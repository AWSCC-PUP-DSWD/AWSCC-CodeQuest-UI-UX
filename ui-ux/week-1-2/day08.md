**<h1 align="center"> DAY 8: Design Sprint (Empathy)</h1>**
**How do UX designers improve the user experience when all websites follow the same layout?**

>**Answer:**   By understanding the user through UX Research

### 📊 UX Research 

The process of understanding the user to get insights on how to improve their user experience. As a UX Researcher, your main goal is to understand the users, their behaviors, motivations, and pain points, and use this information to inform the design process.

### 🏃🏻 Design Sprint 

-   Process in UX Research which is done to deliver innovative, user-friendly solutions within tight timelines. It is a time-bound process with five phases typically spread out over 5 days to 1 week. <br/>
-   Done after the interviews and user research you've conducted _(You won’t be doing it in this workshop)_

    #### 5 Phases:
 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../../assets/tutorials/Day8-pic1.png" height="300" alt="Design Sprint"/></p></br>

  - **Empathize** - understand who your users are and what they need.
  - **Define** - define the user problem you want to solve based on the empathy phase.
  - **Ideate** - come up with possible solutions from the problem you found in the define phase.
  - **Prototype** - turn your ideas from stage three into prototypes.
  - **Test** - putting your prototypes in front of real users and seeing how they interact with it.

## **First Phase: Empathize**

[![Readme Quotes](<https://quotes-github-readme.vercel.app/api?type=horizontal&theme=dracula&quote=You are not your user&author=The False Consensus Effect>)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/false-consensus/) <br/>
**Empathize:**
The first step in any design sprint is to understand the problem from the user's perspective.

### 🧑 User Persona 

  - Are fictional characters created to represent the various user types within a targeted demographic. It is used to build empathy with your target users and identifying exactly what they need from the product you’re designing.

>  **_A persona clarifies who is in your target audience by answering the following questions:_**

-   Who is my ideal customer?
-   What are the current behavior patterns of my users?
-   What are the needs and goals of my users?
-   What issues and pain points do they currently face within the given context?<br/><br/>

### 🗣️ How to communicate empathy in UX 🗣️

**Empathy** is something we should show not only to our users but also to our team members. It helps in visually representing the user’s thoughts, feelings, actions, and motivations.

#### 📍 Empathy Maps

**Empathy Mapping** focuses on identifying key themes and issues affecting users based on their quotes, actions, behaviors, and feelings captured throughout user research and expert interviews. If you’re a UX researcher, common practice is to have one empathy map per customer persona.

-   **Says:** When doing an interview, this is where the overall quotes from the different users is gathered

-   **Thinks:** It is more focused on what a user is thinking and doesn’t choose to say out loud. Example: What are their goals, aspirations, or concerns that might not be explicitly expressed?

-   **Does:** What specific actions do they take in relation to the product or service? This could include physical actions(ex: clicking buttons on a website)

-   **Feels:** Explores the emotion of the user, Example: _“What is the user feeling during this product experience?”_ or _“What worries or excites the user?”_
