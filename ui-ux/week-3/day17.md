**<h1 align="center"> DAY 17: Product Categories </h1>**
**"Curious about how Figma makes online shopping easy with neat categories?"**

Product categories are essential for simplifying the user experience by providing a clear roadmap for finding desired items. By organizing products into distinct groups, users can easily navigate and locate what they're looking for, reducing confusion and speeding up the search process. This intuitive structure not only enhances efficiency but also allows users to explore related products within the same category, creating a more user-friendly and satisfying shopping experience.

Understanding the importance of these categories and learning how to use them effectively can significantly improve the way users navigate and engage with the product. When designing categories, following best practices for visual hierarchy ensures that users can easily understand and prioritize information, contributing to a more user-friendly and intuitive interface.

## **About the Challenge:**

**<h3>Situation</h3>**

As we delve into the development phase of AlfBuddy, a dedicated e-commerce platform for pet products, we've identified a significant challenge. The current arrangement of product titles is disorganized, lacking a structured layout and causing them to be scattered across various product categories. Moreover, the chosen colors don't align with the overall aesthetic, resulting in a less-than-cohesive visual experience for our users.

### âœ… To-Do List

-   Recognize the importance of clear product categorization. 
-   Understand how categories contribute to a positive user experience.
-   Restructure and organize the product categories *(take note: visual hierarchy)*
-   Implement a color palette that harmonizes with the websiteâ€™s aesthetic
-   Refine and standardize product category labels
