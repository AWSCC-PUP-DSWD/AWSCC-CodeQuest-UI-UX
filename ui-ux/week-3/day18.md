**"Discover the design magic everyone's talking about â€“ are you ready to elevate your projects with our Figma best sellers?"**

Showcasing best sellers is vital for businesses, serving as a potent marketing tool that builds trust and streamlines the decision-making process for customers. To design an engaging best sellers section, visual elements like badges and clear categorization enhance user experience. Equally crucial is incorporating user feedback, leveraging customer reviews to provide authenticity and inform ongoing design decisions for continuous improvement. This dynamic approach not only highlights top-performing products but also fosters a sense of community and credibility around them.

## **About the Challenge:**

**<h3>Situation</h3>**

In AlfBuddy, the pet product online store, the "Best Sellers" section is missing some important things. There's no heart icon for a wishlist, and it's not clear how to add things to the cart. Also, we're not seeing how much is left in stock or how many reviews each product has. This makes it hard for people to show interest or make quick decisions. By fixing these things, AlfBuddy can make it easier for users, keep them happy, and maybe even sell more products. It's like making sure the favorite products are saved, making it simple to buy them, and showing how popular and available they are. This way, shopping for pet products becomes way better for everyone.

### âœ… To-Do List

-   Enhance wishlist engagement
-   Implement a discreet button alongside each product
-   Display the remaining stock of popular products prominently
-   Include numbers of reviews for each product
