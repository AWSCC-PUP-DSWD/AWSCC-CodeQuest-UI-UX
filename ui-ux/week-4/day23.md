## Website Responsiveness Design

Have you ever noticed how a website's layout changes everytime you're on different devices? That's because of **Website Responsiveness**! As screen sizes becomes smaller, the layout of the website will adjust to fit its content to the screen.

**_Why is it important?_**

-   It ensures that your website or application is **accessible to users on all devices**. This is important because majority of people are using their smartphones and tablets to access the web.
-   It **improves the user experience** by making it easier for users to interact with your website or application on different devices.
-   Eliminates the need to create separate websites for different devices.
