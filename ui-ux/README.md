**<h3>How to Access Activity Instructions</h3>**

Accessing instructions for activities is a straightforward process. Just follow these four steps to ensure you understand the tasks and resources for each activity:<br><br>

**Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Week**<br>
> Begin by navigating to the correct week. Within each week's folder, you'll find markdown files for each day. Start from Week 1-2/Day 01 and progress until the end of the week and day.

<br>

**Step 2: Read the Instructions and Explore Resources**<br>
> Inside each day's markdown file, you'll find the lessons and instructions for the activities or projects. Take the time to carefully read through the instructions, visit any provided links, and explore games or resources provided. This step ensures you have a clear understanding of the tasks at hand.

<br>

**Step 3: Opening Figma Files**<br>
> If the instructions provide links to Figma files, simply click on the provided link. Upon reaching the Figma page, locate and select the "Open in Figma" button. This action will initiate Figma in your browser. If prompted, log in to your Figma account, ensuring it's active before proceeding.<br><br>After clicking "Open in Figma," the file will be duplicated in your drafts, and you will be redirected to the duplicated version. This copy is now your own Figma file, and you'll share this file as your output. Take note of any specific instructions within Figma for completing tasks or collaborating on design projects. 

<br>

**Step 4: Navigate to the Designated Submission Folder**<br>

> After performing and completing the activities or projects as outlined, proceed to the designated <a href="../submissions/README.md" target="_blank">submissions</a> folder. Read the README file in the submission folder to understand the submission process.
