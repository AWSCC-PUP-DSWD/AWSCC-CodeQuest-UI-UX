**<h3>How to Submit Activities/Projects?</h3>**

Submitting your activities or projects is a simple process. Just follow these three steps to ensure your work is accurately documented and shared with the community:<br><br>

**Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Folder**<br>
> Find the appropriate folder for the day you are submitting outputs. We have two sub-folders for exercises and final projects, making it straightforward for you. These sub-folders contain markdown files for specific days.

<br>

**Step 2: Add Your Work**<br>
> Once you're inside the correct sub-folder, locate the markdown file for the specific day related to the exercise or project you're submitting for. Modify the markdown file to include your output.

<br>

**Step 3: Customize Your Output's Markdown File**<br>
>After locating the specific day's markdown file related to the activity or project you're submitting for, take a moment to customize the file with your outputs. This may involve formatting the text, incorporating images, and providing links. You may refer to this <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax" target="_blank">documentation</a>, search for other tutorials online, or use your existing knowledge to enhance the presentation of your outputs. The key is to ensure that the required outputs from the outlined activities/projects are clearly visible and well-documented within the markdown file. Express your creativity while maintaining clarity and adherence to submission requirements.

<br>

**Step 4: Verify, Commit, and Push Changes**<br>
> After modifying the day's markdown with your activity or project details, commit the changes using your preferred method, such as GitHub Desktop, Git CLI, a Git GUI, or any other tool you are comfortable with. Before pushing, ensure your confidence in the modified files. Afterward, verify the changes in your repository to confirm that they were successfully implemented. This step ensures that you are submitting the correct changes for the community to see.
